# Augmem-AugmententedMemory
AugMem abbreviated for Augmented Memory aims at enabling pre dementia, early dementia including Alzheimerâ€™s patients. Usually people forget faces or names, they tend to forget what place they are at and get lost. They forget what about the time they are in. These small problems accumulate and increase anxiety, social withdrawal and lack of self confidence.

AugMem aims at enhancing the user experience by utilizing Google Glass like Augmented Reality displays to help people with dementia see better. The main feature of the application helps in identifying and and recognizing faces. The name of the person is added for the first time and the image database is updated when adding subsequent images for the same name. We update the user display with Gps based location so that the person is aware of spatial orientation. We provide current time and date on the top corner so that person is reminded of their time orientation. It should be noted that the recognition is based on user input so that it is less cognitive overload.
